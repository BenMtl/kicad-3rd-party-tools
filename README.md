## Schematic Tools

### Schematic Entry Tools

- [Skidl](http://xesscorp.github.io/skidl) - A  module that allows you
to compactly describe the interconnection of electronic circuits and components
using Python. The resulting Python program performs electrical rules checking
for common mistakes and outputs a netlist that serves as input to
a PCB layout tool such as KiCad's PCBNEW.

- [KiField](https://xesscorp.github.io/KiField) - A utility for manipulating
part fields in KiCad schematics. KiField can extract all the component fields
from a schematic and place them into a spreadsheet for bulk editing, after
which you can insert the edited values from the spreadsheet back into the schematic.


### Symbol Library Tools

- [Quick Library Generator](http://kicad.rohrbacher.net/quicklib.php) - A web service to generate common "box type" symbols for ICs from pin descriptions. 

- [KiPart](https://xesscorp.github.io/KiPart) - A utility that generates single
and multi-unit symbols from a CSV file containing all the pin information for
one or more parts.

- [KiField](https://xesscorp.github.io/KiField) - A utility for manipulating
part fields in KiCad symbol libraries. KiField can extract all the component fields
from a library and place them into a spreadsheet for bulk editing, after
which you can insert the edited values from the spreadsheet back into the library.


### BOM Tools

- [KiCost](https://xesscorp.github.io/KiCost) - A utility that generates a
spreadsheet from a schematic filled with the part pricing information scraped
from distributors like Digi-Key, Mouser, etc. For each distributor and part,
the spreadsheet contains the quantity-dependent prices, available quantities,
link to the part page, and ordering codes.



## PCB Layout Tools

### Footprint Library Tools

- [svg2mod](https://github.com/mtl/svg2mod) - A tool to convert multi-layer Inkscape SVGs into footprints. 
- [xess_fp_wizard.py](https://github.com/xesscorp/xess_fp_wizard) - A utility
to make footprints for chips having pins around the periphery (SOICs, QFP, etc.)
and ball grid arrays (BGAs).
